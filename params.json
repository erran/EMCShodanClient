Best of all the author, John Matherly (@achillean), of SHODAN was great at responding and giving me help.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nBefore you can use this Objective-C library to connect to the SHODAN API, you need to have an API key [from SHODAN](http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc).\r\n\r\n###Create and initialize an instance of the WebAPI class:\r\n\r\n    #import \"shodan.h\" //Make sure to import this where you declare your interface.\r\n\r\n    WebAPI* api = [[WebAPI alloc]init_with_api_key:@\"Your API Key\"];\r\n\r\n###Print a list of cisco-ios devices:\r\n\r\n    NSDictionary* result = [api search:@\"cisco\"];\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n    for (id host in [result objectForKey:@\"matches\"]) {\r\n        host = [[result objectForKey:@\"matches\"] objectAtIndex:i];\r\n        i++;\r\n        NSLog(@\"%@\",[host objectForKey:@\"ip\"]);\r\n    }\r\n###Grab all information SHODAN has on a specific ip (4.59.125.121):\r\n\r\n    NSDictionary* host = [api host:@\"4.59.125.121\"];\r\n    NSLog(@\"%@\",host);\r\n\r\n##Authors and Contributors\r\n###Author\r\nErran Carey (@ipwnstuff)\r\n###Contributor\r\nJohn Matherly (@achillean)\r\nJohn provided me with credits I needed to test my library out and he authored the official libraries for the SHODAN API and the SHODAN search engine.\r\n\r\n##Support or Contact\r\nIf your having trouble with any part of my Objective-C library for SHODAN get in contact with me! I'll be sure to update my documentation at a later date but for now contact me at e@ipwnstuff.com or [@ipwnstuff](http://www.twitter.com/#!/ipwnstuff) and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.","name":"SHODAN","google":"","tagline":"Objective-C library for SHODAN"}
