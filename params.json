{"name":"Shodan","tagline":"Objective-C API for Shodan","body":"##Welcome to my Objective-C library for Shodan.\r\nThis library was the first major project I built but I had a whopping three APIs to look at and play with to see what functionality I needed. Best of all the author, John Matherly (@achillean), of Shodan was great at responding and giving me help.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nBefore you can use this Objective-C library to connect to the Shodan API, you need to have an API key [from SHODAN](http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc).\r\n\r\n###Create and initialize an instance of the WebAPI class:\r\n```objective-c\r\n#import \"api.h\" // Import the Shodan API\r\nWebAPI* api = [[WebAPI alloc]init_with_api_key:@\"Your API Key\"];\r\n```\r\n###Print a list of cisco-ios devices:\r\n```objective-c\r\nNSDictionary* result = [api search:@\"cisco\"];\r\nint i = 0;\r\nfor (id host in [result objectForKey:@\"matches\"]) {\r\n    host = [[result objectForKey:@\"matches\"] objectAtIndex:i];\r\n    i++;\r\n    NSLog(@\"%@\",[host objectForKey:@\"ip\"]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n###Grab all information Shodan has on a specific ip (4.59.125.121):\r\n```objective-c\r\nNSDictionary* host = [api host:@\"4.59.125.121\"];\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\",host);\r\n```\r\n##Authors and Contributors\r\n###Author\r\nErran Carey (@ipwnstuff)\r\n###Contributor\r\nJohn Matherly (@achillean)\r\n*John provided me with credits I needed to test my library out and he authored the official libraries for the Shodan API and the Shodan search engine.*\r\nMarcus J. Carey (@marcuscarey)\r\n*My dad contributed to all of the graphics used in the app and concept development.*\r\n\r\n##Support or Contact\r\nIf your having trouble with any part of my Objective-C library for Shodan get in contact with me! I'll be sure to update my documentation at a later date but for now contact me at e@ipwnstuff.com or [@ipwnstuff](http://www.twitter.com/#!/ipwnstuff) and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
