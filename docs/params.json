{"body":"### Welcome to my GitHub User Page. - @ipwnstuff\r\nI'm constantly learning and looking for new projects. Below you can find a portfolio of projects I've authored and released so far.\r\n\r\n### [Objective-C library for SHODAN](https://github.com/ipwnstuff/shodan-objective-c)\r\nThis library was the first major project I built but I had a whopping three APIs to look at and play with to see what functionality I needed. Best of all the author, John Matherly (@achillean), of SHODAN was great at responding and giving me help.\r\n\r\n### [Konami Code](https://github.com/ipwnstuff/konami-code)\r\nThis project specifically includes a view controller which has the ability to receive Konami code input for cheat codes in iOS games. I used it in my app called Bomb Unit to send the user to send the user to the second to last level in the game. Feel free to throw it into your app, there is also a sample project which lets you see it doing an example action.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with one of my projects or suggestions for it? Soon enough I'll set up proper documentation for all my projects but for now contact me at e@ipwnstuff.com  or [@ipwnstuff](http://twitter.com/#!/ipwnstuff) on Twitter and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.","tagline":"@ipwnstuff - Erran Carey","name":"Home |","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
